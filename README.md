## About The App
This is a responsive home page of a car dealership website based on a figma mockup.
The home page is yet to be functional, hence it is specially built for assessment purposes.


## Technologies
I used `React`, `html`, `css` and `Bootstrap` to build this project.

## Setup
- download or clone the repository on your local machine
- run `cd .\car-dealership-ui\` to land on the project main folder
- run `npm install` in order to have all dependencies installed on node modules folder
- run `npm start`to start the React application

## Approach
This project is developed as a single page application, each section is built apart as a React component.
I adopted a mix of inline and external css for the styling of this project.
